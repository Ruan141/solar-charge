What is Solar-Charge?
Solar-Charge is a user-friendly application designed to help electric vehicle (EV) owners, or prospective owners, determine the ideal solar power setup needed to charge their vehicle using renewable energy. In an era where sustainability and energy independence are becoming increasingly vital, Solar-Charge empowers you to make informed decisions about integrating solar power into your EV charging routine.

Why Use Solar-Charge?
Go Green: Reduce your carbon footprint by charging your EV with clean, renewable solar energy, minimizing reliance on fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Save Money: Understand the potential for significant savings on your electricity bills by generating your own power for EV charging.

Achieve Energy Independence: Gain greater control over your energy consumption and reduce your dependence on the grid.

Optimize Your Solar Investment: Before you invest in a solar panel system, Solar-Charge helps you calculate the precise solar array size and battery storage capacity (if desired) to meet your EV's charging demands, preventing overspending or under-sizing.

Easy Planning: The app simplifies complex calculations, making it easy to plan your solar charging setup even if you're not a solar expert.

How Does It Work?
Solar-Charge takes into account various factors to provide accurate recommendations, including:

Your EV's make and model, along with its battery capacity and charging efficiency.

Your typical daily or weekly driving distance.

Your local solar irradiance data (the amount of solar power received in your area).

Desired charging speed and times.

Options for battery storage integration for off-peak charging or cloudy days.
